## Day 4

* Reminder of ways to get help:
    * [tutoring hours](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall18/CSCI-UA.0004-006/common-syllabus/)
    
    * Office hours (has been noted on the syllabus since day 1): Wednesdays from 2-3pm or on Mondays by appointment
    
    * It does not serve you well to ask "quick questions" right after class when there is limited time and a lot of students. You will get better help and access to the answers you need if you talk to me during office hours.

* Quick review of homework

* [Slides for today](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iIwK4jZgbMtxAKWKI9FkzFgO3MVZtbPuftk_LZWm8GM/edit?usp=sharing)
