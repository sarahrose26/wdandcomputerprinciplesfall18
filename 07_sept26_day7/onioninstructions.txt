1. Make the main headline dark green

2. Use the font family "Georgia" for the main headline and the sub-headline

3. Center the text of the main headline and the sub-headline

4. Make the paragraphs have a line height of 19 pixels

6. Make the "You might also like" label all uppercase

7. Follow the directions in the Editor's Note at the bottom of the HTML [age

8. Remove the underline from the links

9. Make an underline appear when you hover over a link


When you are finished, upload your submissions to one team member's i6 account, and submit your link via NYU Classes under the Styling the Onion assignment. Both team members should submit a link, so that you both can receive credit. 

This assignment is worth 2 bonus points on your midterm.
