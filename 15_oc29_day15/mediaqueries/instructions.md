1. Design the page for a small screen

    a. make the font-size larger

    b. adjust the margins

    c. adjust anything else that makes a small screen experience optimized
    
2. Start expanding your browser window width. Do this until you get to a point where the design no longer works. For example, the line length might become too long for the text to be easily readable. Or perhaps the page becomes wide enough that it no long makes sense for the images to display in a stack.

Record the width of the browser window at this point. This will be your first breakpoint. A breakpoint is simply a point at which we're defining that the design should change.

Create a new media query in your browser using the pixel dimension you recorded as the min-width media feature test. Within this breakpoint, change your CSS to do the following:

    a. Change the background color (to help you see when the media query takes effect)
    
    b. Adjust the font-size if necessary
    
    c. Adjust the page margins if necessary
    
    d. Make the photos display in two columns
