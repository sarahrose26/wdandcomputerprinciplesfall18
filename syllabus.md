## Policies
Assignments that you turn in should be your own work. It’s fine to talk to other students and to get assistance in how to do something, but you should not ask another person to do the work for you. For reference, here is the [Computer Science Department’s statement on academic integrity](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html).

## Submitting Assignments
1. Log into NYU Classes with your NYU NetID and password.

2. Click on the tab for the appropriate class.

3. Click on “Assignments” in the navigation bar on the left.

4. Click on the link for the corresponding assignment in the main window.

5. Add whatever comments you may need to under “Assignment Text.”

6. If file attachments are required, compress them and use the following naming convention: lastname_firstname_assignmentnumber.

7. To attach files, click the “Choose File” button under “Attachments” to find the file you wish to submit and select it. Add additional files as necessary. Make sure that the file appears as an attachment before you continue.

8. When you are ready, click the “Submit” button and wait for confirmation before closing the browser window.
Once you have submitted an assignment you can only resubmit it twice, so make sure that what you are submitting is the final version of your work.

## i6 Account
In addition to your NYU Home Account, we will be using a special computer account on a Unix Web server which will be assigned to you automatically based on your enrollment. This is called an “i6” account and we will use it to host our websites. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on [this FAQ page.](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq) If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to [this page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword) for instructions on how to do so.

## Software
Macintosh computers with all of the necessary software installed are available to you in the Student Technology Centers. You do not need your own computer nor do you need to purchase any software. However, you will be learning how to use various programs and may wish to have access to them at home or on your laptop. In this case, you must purchase a subscription or use a trial version, which is sometimes available from the publisher. You can download software provided by ITS to all students, including SFTP programs, by going to the ITS software page.

## Student Technology Centers
The main Student Technology Center (STC) to use for this class is the LaGuardia Co-op. There are other STCs on campus, but this is also where tutors will be available to meet with you. The LaGuardia Co-op is located at 541 LaGuardia Place.

Make sure to save copies of your programs and back them up to other media (such as a flash drive or external hard drive). You can store copies of files on your NYU Home account as well.

## Tutoring
Tutors will be available throughout the semester. Tutoring hours are located on the front page of the common syllabus [here](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall18/CSCI-UA.0004-006/common-syllabus/)
