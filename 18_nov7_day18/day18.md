### Exercise: 

Set up a simple HTML page that includes 4 content blocks: header, footer, and two blocks of your choosing in between. 

Use CSS to fill in these blocks with a background color so they are visible.

Use CSS grid to adjust the size of these blocks so the header fills the top of the page, the bottom fills the bottom of the page, and your two other content blocks are adjusted accordingly inside of the grid container between the header and footer.


### Homework

* Read the section of Chapter 16 in your textbook on CSS Grid, "Test Yourself" and CSS Review as a way to solidify these CSS concepts before we move onto Javascript next week. This will help you on the final exam tremendously!
