## Day 3

* Issues logging into i6? Make sure you consult [the FAQ page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq). Still having issues? Reach out to me ASAP. You need to log into i6 to complete the assignment due on Monday.

* Command line questions?
  * File names with spaces: DON'T DO IT
  * Difference between a directory and a file: You can cd into a directory, not a file. 
  * mkdir and touch need an operator (the name of the file or directory you are creating), or they won't work.
