REMINDER: Final Exam is Wednesday, Dec 19 from 4:00pm-5:50pm in WWH Room 512

The final will be 100 questions, multiple choice. The format is the same as the midterm.  

The questions will address the topics we've covered in class up until now, both theoretical and technical. For part of the exam, you will be asked to look at HTML/CSS/Javascript code and answer questions about it. 

Exam questions are pulled from previous lectures, so please review lecture notes, your in-class notes, and the affiliated readings for each class. Anything we have covered in class this semester is fair game for the exam.
